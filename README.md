# Chain-reaction-game
The Chain Reaction Game is a strategic turn-based game built using Python and Pygame. Players take turns adding atoms to the grid, and when a cell exceeds its atom limit, the atoms explode into neighboring cells, triggering chain reactions. The objective is to dominate the grid by eliminating your opponent's atoms.
